* var vs val
* explicit return stmt
* parentheses not optional (like Gradle, Scala), only for closures
* Main object vs MainTK (toplevel function)
* map/filter returns a list (lazy eval with asSequence)
* C# getter syntax

Examples:
* backtick to deal with functions named as literals
* sealed classes // final-by-default vs open
* case matching (sealed vs non-sealed)
* class vs object
* collections and mutability
